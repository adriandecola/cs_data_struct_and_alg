I tested the code various times adding many different amounts of nodes. I level printed
out each step and checked by hand to make sure my code worked for LL, LR, RL, and RR cases.
In addition, I checked my hand to make sure my post order traversal works. I also tested
adding large amounts of nodes to make sure that there was not ever a new level until
the previous one was full.
