Please note that instructor permission was given to upload these projects.

This course was called Data Structures, Algorithms, and their Applications within Computer Systems. It was offered by the Roux Institute of Northeaster University as a part of their masters program and I was lucky enough to take it through their partnership with Bates College. The course was taught by Professor Jonathan Mwaura. The course was exactly as named. We were fortunate to be introduced concepts pertaining to computer organization, assembly, Makefiles, the software development processes, testing, git, remote servers, and coding in C. 

I uploaded this course pretty much as it was locally as we used git for submissions anyway. I will use this repo for reference and may a repository of my favorite class projects. 

Personal note: I started taking notes with pen and paper after week 8. To help with referencing, heres the topics covered in each homework, lab, and week directory:

Lab 0: Intro to using C, git, and Khoury remote computers
Lab 1: Datatypes, variables, branching, pointers, arrays, looping, functions in C
Lab 2: Typedef and structs in C
Lab 3: Makefile, Valgrind, dynamic memory allocation, and pointers
Lab 4: User defined types, enum vs typedef, structs, and Vectors in C
Lab 5: Recursive functions, creating linked lists, traversing linked list, and merging linked lists
Lab 6: Implementing queues, creating unit tests, and test driven development
Lab 7: Computer organization, memory, assembly, linkers, and the compilation process
Lab 8: Time complexity, space complexity, and merge sort
Lab 9: Balances binary search trees and implementing an AVL tree
Lab 10: Implementing hash tables 

HW 1: Guess the number game
HW 2: Implementing vectors to hold data about students
HW 3: Implementing a stack
HW 4: Problem solving, time complexity, and growth of functions
HW 5: Methods of sorting and proofs
