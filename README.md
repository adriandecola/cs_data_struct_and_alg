Please note that instructor permission was given to upload these projects.

This course was called Data Structures, Algorithms, and their Applications within Computer Systems. It was offered by the Roux Institute of Northeaster University as a part of their masters program and I was lucky enough to take it through their partnership with Bates College. The course was exactly as named and were were fortunate to be introduced concepts pertaining to computer organization and assembly, as well. 

I uploaded this course pretty much as it was locally as we used git for submissions anyway. Because of this I may create a repository of my favorite class projects.
