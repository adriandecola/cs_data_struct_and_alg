Please note that instructor permission was given to upload these projects.

This course was called Data Structures, Algorithms, and their Applications within Computer Systems. It was offered by the Roux Institute of Northeaster University as a part of their masters program and I was lucky enough to take it through their partnership with Bates College. The course was taught by Professor Jonathan Mwaura. The course was exactly as named. We were fortunate to be introduced concepts pertaining to computer organization and assembly, Makefiles, the software development processes, testing, git, remote servers, and coding in C. 

I uploaded this course pretty much as it was locally as we used git for submissions anyway. I will use this repo for reference and may a repository of my favorite class projects.
